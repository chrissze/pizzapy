2.2 Company Locations and Facilities

Computer facilities will initially consist of the owner's existing system.
Telephone - one line currently serves the location. A second line for data use should be added soon.
Utilities are already provided, included in the space rent of $425.
2.3 Company Ownership

Calico Computer Consulting will be created initially as a sole proprietorship, owned and operated by Doug Burham. Incorporation, probably as a LLC, will be explored as a later option.

























Services
Calico Computer Consulting will offer small office/home office business owners a quick-response, reliable source of technical help for their computers.

CCC will offer three main services - Hourly Technical Aid, Retainer contracts for specific skills or systems, and Project consulting.
There appear to be four main classes of competition, the largest of which consists of individual proprietors and smaller consulting firms such as CCC. The competitive edge for CCC will be to expand on already existing relationships.
CCC will start with some basic sales literature, including logo and stationary, a brochure, and a basic web page. These will be self-designed and computer generated, of course.
Fulfillment of services will be provided exclusively by CCC's owner.
Technology is obviously a critical component of this business: It will be important to stay up to date on both equipment and knowledge to remain competitive in the future.
Detailed descriptions of these points are found in the sections below.

3.1 Service Description

Calico Computer Consulting will offer three main services, corresponding to what industry experts have identified as the primary opportunities in computer consulting:

Hourly (Temporary Technical Aid) - The less traditional sort of short term assignment helping a company solve a software or hardware related problem. Includes both emergency and non-emergency technical assistance.
Retainer (Specific Skill) - The more traditional form of consulting, including regular system maintenance, software and hardware upgrades, and network administration. The owner's particular area of expertise is in management consulting with regard to MIS.
Project (Bail-out or Specific Skill) - This will include such things as consulting on major purchases, system/network installation and testing, and major disaster recovery.
3.2 Sales Literature

Calico Computer Consulting will start with some basic self-generated literature to establish initial positioning:

Logo and theme - A national catalog sales paper goods company has a wonderful line of blank papers with a computer theme that will serve as the "look" for CCC. A graphic artist friend of the owner has already commenced work on a matching logo.
Stationery - The theme paper is available in various formats for use as company stationery.
Brochure - Likewise, pre-printed paper is available, along with software templates for generating brochures
Web Presence - Eventually a website will be developed as an "electronic brochure" as well as a resource site for the owner's established client base.
Response Templates - As common problems/solutions are encountered and solved, a set of standardized templates for initial responses will be developed. This will shorten response time and eliminate confusion in providing quick solutions to routine issues.
3.3 Fulfillment

The fulfillment of services for CCC is provided by the owner. The ultimate deliverable is the owner's expertise and problem solving ability, coupled with an open mind and ease of communication that will result in the customer's complete confidence in immediate and lasting results.

3.4 Competitive Comparison

There seems to be four major classes of competition in the local computer consulting industry:

In-house MIS consultants - Usually employed by larger companies that can afford the fixed cost of a salaried or hourly employee.
Individual proprietors & smaller consulting firms - As noted elsewhere in this plan, the bulk of Yellow Page advertisements are comprised of this group.
Larger network and telecommunications consulting firms - Large, known-name companies such as Network One that specialize in providing total MIS services to larger companies that choose to outsource.
Computer and electronics stores offering consulting services.
Of course, Calico Computer Consulting fits into the largest group as a sole proprietorship. The primary reason that customers would buy from CCC rather than competitors is the existing relationships that exist. Customer loyalty and satisfaction are the way to success for small service businesses such as this.

3.5 Technology

Technology is, of course, vital to the success of Calico Computer Consulting. It is imperative that the owner stay up-to-date on the latest technological developments in the computer industry. In addition, it will be important to devote a reasonable portion of each year's revenues toward upgrading the equipment and software used by CCC in its normal operations.







Market Analysis Summary
Calico Computer Consulting will adopt a fairly intently focused market strategy.

A logical segmentation breaks the market down into the following: Home Office Businesses, Small Businesses, Medium Businesses and Large Businesses. Descriptions are provided below.
The largest and most logical target markets for CCC are the Home Office and Small Businesses. These businesses mostly have a need for temporary technical aid, usually billed at an hourly rate. Some opportunity does exist, however, for retainer and/or specific project contracts.
While there are a fair number of competitors in the local area, they seem to be widely specialized and widely sized, leaving ample opportunity for CCC to create and expand a niche in the chosen market segments.
Finally worth noting is the growth trend for this market, estimated at around 9 to 10 percent annually through the beginning of the next century.
4.1 Market Segmentation

The following chart and table reflect the market segmentation for this business. The size and growth numbers are based on US Census data for the local region.

Home Office Businesses - The largest and fastest growing segment, this segment is obviously defined as small businesses that are based primarily out of the owner's home. This is not the same as simple home computer users, which sources warn are NOT a viable market segment for computer consulting.
Small Businesses - Defined by the government as businesses with 1 to 99 employees, this is the second largest and fastest growing segment in Eugene and Lane County.
Medium Businesses - 100 to 499 employees.
Large Businesses - 500 or more employees.
As is obvious in the pie chart, the first two segments comprise the bulk of opportunity for Calico Computer Consulting.

4.2 Target Market Segment Strategy

Entrepreneur Magazine suggests six market segments as a starting point:

Businesses not using computers
Small entrepreneurial businesses using one or more computers
Small to medium sized corps using computers on networks
Large corps seeking problem-solving assistance (trouble-shooting) with specific projects
Government agencies, corporations, and other organizations in search of computer training
Businesses in search of custom computer programming services
Calico Computer Consulting will focus on the top market segments only - an intently focused marketing strategy.

4.2.1 Market Trends

Three primary market trends seem to be most important in this industry:

Trend #1 - most important -rapid growth in technology, need for continuous upgrades in both hardware and software.
Trend #2 - moderately important -predicted continued growth in consulting/outsourcing - companies being unwilling to pay fixed costs of salaries, choosing instead to treat computer upgrades and repair as variable costs.
Trend #3 - least important - rapid growth in ratio of SOHO businesses to traditional medium sized businesses.
These trends are predicted by industry experts to continue well into the next century.

4.2.2 Market Growth

As noted in the previous section, several factors are predicted to continue well into the next decades, not the least of which are the growth rates for this market:

Growth rate citation - Entrepreneur Magazine says that the consulting industry in general will continue to grow at an annual rate of 9.1%
Growth rate citation - Census data for each identified segment in the Lane County area roughly parallel this growth rate.
Growth rate citation - Eugene Chamber of Commerce published data supports the Federal Census data, predicting continued and rapid growth particularly in the small office/home office market segment.
4.2.3 Market Needs

According to Entrepreneur Magazine, experts in the consulting industry have identified three different opportunities that exist for computer consultants:

1.  Temporary Technical Aid

Short term assignments finding solutions for businesses - this is noted as the largest market
2.  Specific Skill - the largest area is software specialty, the second largest area

System setup & purchasing guidance
Systems reengineering/optimization
Network Admin
Training
Repair
Database/Application development
Data Storage
Disaster Recovery
Security/Data Protection
Telecommunications
3.  Bail-Out (Trouble shooting)

According to Entrepreneur Magazine, private home computer users are NOT a viable market for computer consultants.

4.3 Service Business Analysis

The computer consulting business for the local area is already well established, yet still allows ample opportunity for entry and growth for new participants. This is supported by the following points:

While there already exists a large number of consultants, there is also a wide range of sizes and specialties. This leaves plenty of opportunity for CCC to find and develop a particular niche.
Customers in this industry tend to be loyal, relying on the same consultant for future needs once a relationship has been established.
An analysis of CCC's main competitors shows no overwhelming strengths that would be significant barriers to CCC's success. Likewise, identifying competitor's weaknesses has illuminated several areas that CCC can target as marketing strategies.
In short, this business arena, while no longer brand new, is far from exhausted as an opportunity for a new and aggressive company or sole proprietor. By utilizing a logical and comprehensive marketing approach, CCC should easily find success in the computer consulting business.

4.3.1 Business Participants

A search of the local Yellow Pages revealed the following:

Under the heading Consultants - Computer & Data Processing there were a total of four listings
Under Computers - Service & Repair there were 51 total listings, the majority of which seemed to be stores or companies
Under Computers - Software & Services there were 88 total listings. Thirteen of those were large companies such as [name omitted], [name omitted], and [name omitted] (a Portland firm). Sixteen were specialists in accounting software that listed CPA's on their staff.
Under Computers - System Designers & Consultants there were 45 total listings. About half had larger listings and/or company names that implied larger size. Throughout all the listings, only four were clearly listed as individual practitioners. The most unique (and catching) name amongst all listings was "[name omitted]."
The conclusion is that while there a fair number of competitors in the geographic area, they are widely specialized and widely sized. Many of the larger participants appear to cater to larger clients, thus leaving plenty of opportunity for Calico Computer Consulting to focus on its chosen market segments.

4.3.2 Main Competitors

Below are examples of a brief analysis of CCC's main competitors.

1. Competitor 1 [name omitted]

Top strength - A very memorable name that will stick in customer's minds.
Primary weakness - a focus primarily on one operating system (not used by businesses).
2. Competitor 2 [name omitted]

Top strength - Longevity and experience, someone who has been in the business locally a long time.
Primary weakness - Slow response and an unwillingness to take on new customers.
A much more comprehensive discussion of these strategies is presented in the CCC Marketing Plan (written in Marketing Plan Pro).

4.3.3 Competition and Buying Patterns

As noted above, the local computer consulting industry is fragmented, with a wide variety of sizes and specialties. Two general factors of competition immediatly show up in the analysis:

The larger competitors seem to be grouped into two main categories: those who provide network expertise to large companies, and those who provide "consulting" service to products they sell.
Of the smaller sized companies, about half still seemed to favor larger businesses as their clients.
Customer buying patterns also highlight the opportunity for Calico Computer Consulting. While larger companies tend to hire larger consulting firms, the home business/small business owner tends to favor the personal relationship that can develop with the smaller consulting firm. Several small business owners interviewed for this research admitted being intimidated and overwhelmed by the prospect of calling a larger firm to come "rescue them." They much preferred calling a person they already knew for help.

This leads to another very important buying pattern. Customers who have established a relationship with a computer consultant tend to stay very loyal as long as the service and results remain acceptable. This will be critical to the success of a new company like CCC.

















Strategy and Implementation Summary
Calico Computer Consulting will focus on the following to establish and grow the business:

Four main promotion strategies: networking and referrals, web based promotion, traditional media advertising, and some non-traditional promotion methods.
A value proposition of timely and practical solutions, at a reasonable rate, coupled with a 100% guarantee.
A competitive edge based on cultivating existing customer relationships.
A comprehensive and detailed marketing and sales strategy, covered in depth in a separate marketing plan.
5.1 Strategy Pyramid

Most of the textbooks and/or experienced business people who contributed to the research for this plan suggested some combination of the following four marketing strategies. These are especially suited for a modern high tech business such as computer consulting.

Strategy 1 - Networking & Referrals - Using existing contacts and clients to build a larger network of potential clients.
Strategy 2 - Web promotion - Using a web page to showcase the owner's skills and knowledge, providing an "electronic brochure" as well as useful technical information free of charge.
Strategy 3 - Advertising - Traditional methods such as Yellow Page ads, newspaper classified and display ads, local television cable access advertisements.
Strategy 4 - Non-traditional - Creative and unique advertising such as door hangers, bumper stickers, etc.
A much more comprehensive discussion of these strategies is presented in the CCC Marketing Plan (written in Marketing Plan Pro).

5.2 Value Proposition

The value proposition offered by Calico Computer Consulting is quite simple: timely and practical solutions for client's computer problems and/or upgrades, all at a very reasonable and competitive rate. Most important, CCC offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee, thus building and retaining the client's confidence.

5.3 Competitive Edge

CCC's competitive edge is that the owner already has a significant number of high quality relationships with current and potential clients. In essence, CCC has already overcome the barriers to entry in the consulting field and is simply in the process of formalizing the business.

5.4 Marketing Strategy

The topics below briefly outline the marketing strategy for Calico Computer Consulting. A much more comprehensive discussion of these strategies is presented in the CCC Marketing Plan (written in Marketing Plan Pro).

5.4.1 Marketing Programs

The most important marketing program for CCC is to get the word out, through a combination of the following:

Sending a letter of announcement and brochure to all existing contacts and customers.
Following the well-established steps of a public relations campaign (press releases, announcements, etc.).
Developing and purchasing "grand opening" announcements in the local news media.
A much more comprehensive discussion of these programs is presented in the CCC Marketing Plan (written in Marketing Plan Pro).

5.4.2 Positioning Statement

For the home business/small business owner who needs technical help with their business computers, Calico Computer Consulting provides fast and effective response that gets the business back up and running. Unlike [key competition], CCC offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

5.4.3 Pricing Strategy

Calico Computer Consulting will adopt a price matching strategy rather than entry pricing. A survey of local consulting businesses revealed the following:

Hourly Rate Pricing - The average price charged was $75.00 per hour.
Retainer Pricing - Based on the expected minimum number of hours per month, the average was $150.
Project Pricing - Based on a daily rate (8 hours x $75.00/hour)
5.4.4 Promotion Strategy

The primary promotion strategy for CCC will be directly in line with the strategy pyramids mentioned previously. The lead strategy will be to focus on cultivating existing relationships, using known networking techniques to develop referrals and new customer leads. Added to this will be a blend of web based marketing and traditional public relations and media marketing. The ultimate promotion strategy, however, will be in guaranteeing customer satisfaction: happy customers will generate repeat and new business.

5.5 Sales Strategy

Sales strategy for Calico Computer Consulting is simple and straightforward: customer satisfaction! Happy customers will be repeat customers, and they will provide referrals to new customers.

Sales forecast figures are based on industry figures for the typical growth of a consulting startup and reflect repeat business generated through meeting customer needs.
Sales programs must be based on the notion that business is driven on customer demand when problems arise. While some business can be generated by soliciting customers to upgrade their systems and software, by and large the bulk of the business will be emergency technical aid.
A much more comprehensive discussion of the sales strategy is presented in the CCC Marketing Plan (written in Marketing Plan Pro).

5.5.1 Sales Forecast

The sales figures shown below include the projection based solely on hourly rate consulting during the first year of business. Yearly figures for subsequent years include the growth of retainer and project consulting income as business grows.

Cost of sales for consulting services are the hourly payments earned by the owner.
