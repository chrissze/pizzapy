SECTION: STRUCTURE







SECTION: FOLDER STRUCTURE AND IMPORT
------------------------------------
This program has a 2-layer folder structure. The parent folder 'pizzapy' has the following files
    .gitignore
    __init__.py             
    main.py
    main_script.py
    requirements.txt
    documentation.txt


SECTION: CUSTOM LIBRARIES
--------------------------
I have custom libraries like batterypy and dimsumpy, in order to use them, they must be at sys.path, so that python programs can import them. site-packages folder is in sys.path (search path), so I must put the custom libraries into site-packages, or create symlinks in site-packages to point to the custom libraries.

Sometimes, if I need to use modules in the same program, I need to append parent program folder to the sys.path.

    import sys; sys.path.append('..')
